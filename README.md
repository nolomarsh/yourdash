# YourDash

YourDash is a simple mock food-ordering application. Users can sign up to create an account stored in a PostgreSQL database through a Java/Spring-Boot backend, and search restaurants within a chosen range of a given street address. Users are then free to browse menus and add items to a shopping cart.
